                    be caused by a virus. Hilleman showed that these infections were, in fact, caused by a species of
                    bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, that grows only inside of cells.

                    <strong>1948 to 1957</strong> - As chief of the Department of Respiratory Diseases at Army Medical
                    Center (now the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research), Hilleman discovered the genetic changes
                    that occur when the influenza virus mutates, known as antigenic shift and antigenic drift, which he
                    theorized would mean that a yearly influenza vaccination would be required.
                    <br><br>Hilleman served on numerous national and international advisory boards and committees,
                    academic, governmental and private, including the National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS
                    Research Program Evaluation and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the National

                    <strong>1957</strong> - Hilleman joined Merck & Co. (Kenilworth, New Jersey), as head of its new
                    virus and cell biology research department in West Point, Pennsylvania. It was while with Merck that
                    Hilleman developed most of the forty experimental and licensed animal and human vaccines with which
                    he is credited, working both at the laboratory bench as well as providing scientific leadership.
                    <br><br>Hilleman was among the first to recognize that a 1957 outbreak of influenza in Hong Kong
                    could become a huge pandemic. Working on a hunch, after nine 14-hour days he and a colleague found
                    that it was a new strain of flu that could kill millions. Forty million doses of vaccines were
                    prepared and distributed. Although 69,000 Americans died, the pandemic could have resulted in many
                    more deaths in the United States. Hilleman was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal from the
                    American military for his work. His vaccine is believed to have saved hundreds of thousands of
                    lives.

                    <strong>1963</strong> - His daughter Jeryl Lynn came down with the mumps. He cultivated material
                    from her, and used it as the basis of a mumps vaccine. The Jeryl Lynn strain of the mumps vaccine is
                    still used today. The strain is currently used in the trivalent (measles, mumps and rubella) MMR
                    vaccine that he also developed, the first vaccine ever approved incorporating multiple live virus
                    strains. Like many other vaccines and medications of that time period, the vaccine was initially
                    tested in children with intellectual disabilities who lived in group homesâ€”this was because, given
                    the poor hygiene and cramped quarters of their accommodations, they were at much higher risk of
                    infectious disease.

                    <strong>1981</strong> - He and his group invented a vaccine for hepatitis B by treating blood serum
                    with pepsin, urea and formaldehyde. This was licensed in 1981, but withdrawn in 1986 in the United
                    States when it was replaced by a vaccine that was produced in yeast. This vaccine is still in use
                    today. By 2003, 150 countries were using it and the incidence of the disease in the United States in
                    young people had decreased by 95%. Hilleman considered his work on this vaccine to be his single
                    greatest achievement. Liver transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl said "...controlling the hepatitis B
                    virus scourge ranks as one of the most outstanding contributions to human health of the twentieth
